# Shopify Editions Summer 2023

This repo is where I'm experimenting with what's available in [Shopify Editions Summer, 2023](https://www.shopify.com/editions/summer2023)

We're using my [Next.js x Prisma ORM Shopify app boilerplate]() to build, so would be a good idea to see [SETUP](/docs/SETUP.md) to see how to set this up.

Things can and will break, please don't use it in production.

## Notes

Notes are cleanly organized in the app itself, so once you get the app up and running, you can see things live and in action. This is deliberately done so I don't get comments on features you haven't even tried out yet.
